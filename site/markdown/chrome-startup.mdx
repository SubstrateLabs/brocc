Brocc connects to Chrome in order to sync your browsing activity. Brocc needs Chrome to be running in a specific configuration, and may prompt you to relaunch Chrome. 

To prevent losing your open tabs when Brocc relaunches Chrome, configure your Chrome startup settings to continue where you left off:

1. Copy this URL into your Chrome address bar: <InlineCode code={`chrome://settings/?search=startup`} />

2. Select **Continue where you left off**:

<Image src="/chrome-startup.png" alt="Chrome startup settings" width={800} height={600} className="rounded-md" />
