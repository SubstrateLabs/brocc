We're using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io) to distribute the beta version of Brocc, but plan to release a more traditional application in the future.

After installing with pipx, you can launch the app by running `brocc` in your terminal.

In the terminal UI that appears, you'll see a button to log in. Once you're logged in, your terminal will launch a window with the Brocc UI.

Brocc can only connect to Chrome if it's running in a specific configuration, and will guide you to relaunch Chrome.

We recommend updating your Chrome startup settings so you don't lose your open tabs:

1. Copy this URL into your Chrome address bar: <InlineCode code={`chrome://settings/?search=startup`} />

2. Select **Continue where you left off**:

  height={600}
  className="rounded-md"
/>
