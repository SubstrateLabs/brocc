# ðŸ¥¦ Brocc

Brocc is a work-in-progress tool for searching and analyzing personal data. 

The name comes from our codename for the project, BrOCCLI: **Br**owser-**O**bserver **C**ontent-**C**ollection **L**iquid-**I**nterface. (The initial form of the product is a CLI).


## Principles

Indexing personal data is a big responsibility. We believe this kind of software should be:

1. **Local-first**: Your data is stored on your machine. AI features may use cloud services, but Brocc _never_ logs or store your data remotely.
2. **Source-visible**: You can verify Brocc's promise to never store your data.
3. **Open-contribution**: Though Brocc isn't fully open-source (see the BSL [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)), we believe in open-contribution software (and may compensate top contributors).
4. **Extensible + malleable**: Power users get an Interactive Computational Environment: Extensible Foundations, Malleable User Interfaces, and Ergonomic Client APIs.

(see [PHILOSOPHY](._NOTES/PHILOSOPHY.md) for more background)

## Roadmap

### Part 1: Extensible Foundations

- `0.0.1`: A CLI that connects to your **browser history**.
  - [ ] Read browser history up to a selected timeframe
  - [ ] Index common feeds:
    - [x] Twitter
    - [x] Substack
    - [ ] Gmail
  - [ ] Parse PDFs, including metadata for research articles
  - [ ] Chunk long articles and PDFs semantically
  - [ ] Search for "AI-related content", and get back feed items from multiple sources with an AI summary.
- `0.0.2`: A CLI that connects to **web services**.
  - [ ] OAuth connection to index:
    - [ ] Notion
    - [ ] Slack
    - [ ] Discord
    - [ ] WhatsApp
    - [ ] Telegram
- `0.0.3`: A CLI that connects to your **filesystem**.
  - [ ] Index local Mac applications
    - [ ] iMessage
    - [ ] Photos
    - [ ] Notes
  - [ ] Index local files
    - [ ] PDFs
    - [ ] Markdown files

## Architecture

### brocc-li (Python CLI)

All local application technology is embedded, except AI inference (currently, all AI models run via cloud services). A long-term goal is to offer an option for local inference, which would enable fully on-device operation (and offline or low-data mode).

Dependencies:

- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org): Embedded columnar database that stores document data. Because access patterns are more analytical than transactional, DuckDB's columnar storage is a good fit.
- [Polars](https://docs.pola.rs): DataFrame library, leverages Apache Arrow to avoid loading entire datasets into memory.
- [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb): Embedded vector database, enables semantic search.
- [Textual](https://www.textualize.io): Terminal UI framework.
- [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev): Agent framework.
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quickstart): AI routing service, allows user-scoped API keys to access cloud AI models.

AI models:

- [voyage-multimodal-3](https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/11/12/voyage-multimodal-3): Embeds text and images in the same latent space, enabling multimodal search. This model must be run in the cloud until open-source alternatives improve in quality.

### site (NextJS site)

The web component of Brocc is intentionally minimal (following the Local-first principle). We use the site for authentication and collaboration features.

- [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction): We store as little as possible in Postgres. What we do store: users, API keys, and collaboration settings.
- Cloudflare [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2): Free egress, cheaper than alternatives. We use it to store published data.
- [WorkOS](https://workos.com): Easier maintenance than DIY, cheaper than alternatives.
- Upstash [Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted): We use Redis to cache session information (with short TTL).
