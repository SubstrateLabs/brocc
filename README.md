> Brocc: BRowser-Observer Content-Collection Liquid-Interface

Brocc is a work-in-progress tool for searching and analyzing personal data.

## Principles

Indexing personal data is a big responsibility. We believe this kind of software should be:

1. **Local-first**: Your data belongs on your machine. AI features may use cloud services, but we *never log or store your data in the cloud*.
2. **Source-visible**: You can verify our promise to not store your data.
3. **Open-contribution**: Though we're not fully open-source (see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)), we believe in the power of open-contribution software, and may compensate top contributors.
4. **Extensible and malleable**: The big vision is an interactive computational environment, built on extensible foundations with malleable interfaces.
