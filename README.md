# ðŸ¥¦ Brocc

Brocc is a new way to index and explore your digital life.

Try the beta CLI:

1. Install: `pipx install brocc-li`
2. Run: `brocc`

<summary><h2>Why</h2></summary>

Your documents are scattered. They might be:

1. On your local filesystem (PDFs, photos, iMessages)
2. Accessible via developer APIs (Notion, Google Docs, Gmail)
3. In your browser (browsing history)

<summary><h2>Principles</h2></summary>

Indexing personal data is a big responsibility. We believe this kind of software should be:

1. **Local-first**: Your data belongs on your computer. Brocc never logs or stores your data remotely. AI features use cloud services.
2. **Source-visible**: You can review our system design below, and inspect the code to verify our promise to never store your data.
3. **Open-contribution**: We aspire to build a rich open-contribution community.

<summary><h2>System Design</h2></summary>

Our general preference is to build robust embedded software that can run locally with minimal system requirements. We carefully choose dependencies that have this quality themselves, making pragmatic exceptions:

1. We host a light web application, used primarily for authentication.
2. AI models run remotely, because we prefer software with minimal system requirements.

## Primary dependencies

### Local app ([/cli](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/brocc/tree/main/cli))

- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org): Embedded columnar database that stores document data. Because access patterns are more analytical than transactional, DuckDB's columnar storage is a good fit.
- [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb): Embedded vector database using [Lance](https://github.com/lancedb/lance) storage format.
- [Polars](https://docs.pola.rs): DataFrame library, leverages Apache Arrow to avoid loading entire datasets into memory.
- Embeddings (for ingestion + queries) use [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/) via our [API proxy](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/brocc/blob/main/site/app/api/embed/route.ts).
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quickstart): AI routing. LLM API requests are made locally from your computer, using the OpenRouter API key we [provision](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/brocc/blob/main/site/lib/user-lifecycle.ts) for your account.
- [Textual](https://www.textualize.io) TUI app manages:
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) local app server
  - [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/docs) local frontend
  - [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/guide) and [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray)
  - [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) to read content from your browser

### Website ([/site](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/brocc/tree/main/site))

- [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction): Used to store users, API keys, and collaboration settings.
- [WorkOS](https://workos.com): Used for auth.
- [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted): Used to cache session information.
- [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2): Used to store published datasets.

### Data lifecycle

0. We ingest documents from sources (1) in your browser, (2) via APIs, and (3) on your local filesystem.
1. Document is converted to Markdown.
2. Markdown is chunked using a heuristic that preserves section boundaries.
3. Document metadata and chunk content are stored in DuckDB.
4. Chunked markdown is embedded multimodally (interleaved text and images).
5. Chunk embeddings are stored in LanceDB, filterable by metadata.
