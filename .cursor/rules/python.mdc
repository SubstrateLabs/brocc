Always use terse, concise function docstrings. Only document params that are not self-documenting and have non-obvious behavior.
Always follow the Ruff and Pyright rule settings in [pyproject.toml](mdc:cli/pyproject.toml). Remember:
- Do not use bare except
- Do not use f-strings for simple strings without variables 
You can use our [Makefile](mdc:cli/Makefile) to run commands:
- `make format`: format and autofix lint issues
- `make test`: run all tests with pytest. note you should use `uv run pytest` if you want to run an individual test file (or use other pytest features).
