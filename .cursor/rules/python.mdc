Always follow the Ruff and Pyright rule settings in [pyproject.toml](mdc:cli/pyproject.toml). Remember:
- Do not use bare except
- Do not use f-strings for simple strings without variables 
You can use our [Makefile](mdc:cli/Makefile) to run commands:
- `make format`: format and autofix lint issues
- `make test`: run all tests with pytest
Always use markdown-it-py to parse markdown, instead of regex.
