# Adding logs
When adding logs to Python files, use [logger.py](mdc:brocc-li/src/brocc_li/utils/logger.py) (rather than print or Rich console). 

You should not *always* add logs, but you should if you are debugging an issue, or handling an error scenario or edge case. Logs should be:
1. Focused (do not log in a redundant or overly noisy way. The signal to noise ratio should be high).
2. Concise and well-formatted (pretty-format JSON, use newlines to wrap long content, truncate potentially long values injected into format strings)
