- markdown extraction (unstructured)
- pdf handling (docling)
- deepresearch: latest best pdf/paper metadata tool
- schema design:
  - source / location: needs another layer
    - chrome::<location name: twitter>::<location: url>
  - field for parent doc id
    - capture parent doc for threads, comments
    - is this the same as "parent url" for browser nav?
- rework prototype extract code

## backlog

- AI: pydanticai + openrouter
- cli oauth flow
- lucide icons in fasthtml
