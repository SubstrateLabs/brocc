Our activity on the internet leaves a long trail of "digital exhaust". Digital exhaust lives in several places:

1. Various browsers (mobile, web, in-app)
2. Web-and-native applications (Gmail, Notion, Discord, ChatGPT, etc)
3. Native-only applications (iMessage)
4. Files you've saved on your computer (PDFs, images, etc)
