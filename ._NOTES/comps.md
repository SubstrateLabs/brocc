- Zotero - Erik: feels like managing an itunes library, chatting or doing vector search on that data is just awesome
  - as someone who's so often in the position of "i know i read a paragraph about this in the last 6 months"
- among the people who "do care" about AI (and are willing to think about it and use it), it's so hugely polarizing
- can imagine a version of this that would pull in RSS feeds too. i have like 200 things on my rss, it's a lot of things
- game idea: strikes me as "both an obvious and a good idea". reminds me of this program where you pretend like you have 1M followers... simulates what if you're a famous influencer, and it's really sticky. kinda a similar thing.
- fed has stats on how people spend their time, one thing i learned is they have data on how much reading americans have been doing - really fascinating and depressing, 2003-present, 1982-present. reported reading time is down by about half.
- a very fun activity to institutionalize will be a pseudo-monastic summer reading camp, lock up devices, read, talk about it
- 2 stats:
  - if you're a man under 24, over 50% chance you've placed a sports bet in the last week
  - relatively recent app that uses fake currency that's training 13-18yr olds to do sports betting
  - if you ask americans based on generational strata about what they consider a good salary.
    - 100-200k normal for older. for gen-z it's 550k
- multiple students have mentioned: millenials get benefits of technological confidence without getting their brains formed by them
- americans have been in a relative position of health, wealth, power for basically all of living memory, about to find out if that will really change
- in the 19th c people sold paprika and it was largely brick dust
- annoyed by the omnipresence of stoicism as a guiding ideology, but it's good to take action on what you can control
- good to be informed in a general sense, doubly good to inform others, but the cost of that is a tremendous amount of time
- would bet on ulcers going up
- andrew: said he learned something from a buddy in the airforce, "you know yellowstone national park, there are enough nukes nearby that if the yellowstone caldera blew the world is over". wakes up everyday grateful that our hubris hasn't killed us yet.
- the concept of meritocracy was invented in a 1953 british satire mocking the idea that the houses of parliament could ever eliminate the father to son inheritance based on some basis of talent. he called it "the rise of the meritocracy" and a bunch of people thought it was real.
