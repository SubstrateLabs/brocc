- maybe remove source_type?
- do we need another field to capture chrome as source? or rethink source_type?
- chrome::<location name: twitter>::<location: url>
- should we save "previous url"? (no, timestamps sufficient)
- field for parent doc id?
- capture parent doc for threads, comments
- is this the same as "parent url" for browser nav?
